## 🖋️SCHOOL PROJECT🖋️

# My Hoard

The front-end of my final Tech HighSchool project. A website built "for goblins to show off their things"
(Not currently functional due to lack of host for the back-end).


## Features

- Home feed;
- Login and signup forms;
- Insertions of "things", with details such as size, age and pictures;
- Categorization of "things" with colorful, point-based categories;
- Ranking system for users.
